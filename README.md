# Sorting-Algorithms-Comparisions
Comparative empirical analysis of different sorting algorithms like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge sort.

Implementing Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge sort to sort numbers in non-decreasing order. Running these functions large number of times for arrays of different sizes (n) (100k, 150k, 200k up to 1000k).Used random number generator to generate arrays elements.

## Comparsions performed

1. Size of list Vs no of element to element comparisons
2. Size of list Vs execution time
